# Happy99 Castration Project
A project that aims to castrate the original Happy99 virus and turn it into just a beautiful retro fireworks app.

## Original Virus Demo
Danooct1 made an video in 2011 demoing the original virus, you can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bwpt0EyOSM0

## Objectives
Simply castrate the virus capabilities from the source code and recompile it into a retro fireworks application. Later on maybe port it to SDL2 or something else.

## Why?
Why not? Knowledge is good.

## Info
The original readme.rtf is long lost, in the `original` folder you can find an PDF version of it and also the asm file containing the entire virus' (unaltered) source code. If you want the original unaltered compiled binary, google it (i know it's not exactly dangerous but i'm not distributing the executable of something classified as a virus).

## Contributing
PRs are open. Know wasm? Wanna help? Have fun? Go wild at it.
